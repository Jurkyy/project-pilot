# project-pilot
A tool that automatically builds the base of a project, including docker setup, from a ChatGPT query.

Heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/security-union/code-muse-rs/) project. This project aims to improve upon the orginal idea and add some extra features like, but not limited to:
- OPEN_API_KEY specification and checking
- More robust error handling
- Better rustlang codestyle adherence
- Removes the jokes
- Project path specification
